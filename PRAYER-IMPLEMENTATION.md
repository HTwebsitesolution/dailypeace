# Prayer Implementation in Daily Peace

## Current Status

Prayers are **automatically included** in conversational mode responses.

### Implementation Details

**Location:** `netlify/functions/generate.ts`

**Conversational Mode Prompt:**
```
- Include a brief prayer TO GOD (not as God) in 40-60 words
```

**How It Works:**
1. The AI generates a response that includes encouragement, Scripture references, a reflection question, AND a prayer
2. The prayer is embedded within the response text (not a separate field)
3. The prayer is written "TO GOD" (not as if the AI is speaking as God)
4. Typical format: "Dear God, [prayer content]. Amen."

**Example Response Structure:**
```
[Encouragement and Scripture guidance - 140-220 words]
[Reflection question]

Dear God, [personalized prayer about the user's concern]. Amen.
```

### Modes Comparison

| Mode | Prayer Included? | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Conversational** | ✅ Yes | 40-60 word prayer embedded in response |
| **Reflective** | ❌ No | Focus on contemplative insights, 2 reflection questions instead |
| **Biblical** | ❌ No | Only Scripture verses returned |

### Verification

Looking at the test response from the smoke test:
```json
{
  "text": "...When we talk to Him about our concerns, His peace can guard our hearts and minds, helping us feel more settled. Remember, even in times of uncertainty, God is holding you close and guiding you.\n\nAs you think about your future, try to focus on one step at a time, trusting that God will provide what you need along the way. What is one thing you can do today to help ease your worries?\n\nDear God, I come before You with my worries about the future. Help me to trust in Your presence and guidance. May Your peace fill my heart and mind as I seek to lean on You. Amen.",
  ...
}
```

✅ The prayer is included at the end of the response text.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to enhance the prayer experience when you return:

1. **Separate Prayer Display:** Extract and display prayer in a distinct UI element
2. **Prayer Highlights:** Make the prayer section more visually prominent
3. **Prayer Actions:** Add "Copy Prayer" or "Share Prayer" buttons
4. **Custom Prayer Mode:** Allow users to request just a prayer
5. **Prayer History:** Track and save prayers for users to revisit
